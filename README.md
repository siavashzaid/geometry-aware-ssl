This repository contains the code for my bachelor thesis on geometry-agnostic
sound source localization using graph neural networks and an attention
mechanism.

The proposed model follows a hybrid architecture in which a graph neural
network encodes the microphone array geometry and inter-microphone
relationships, while a transformer-based attention mechanism contextualizes
these geometry-aware embeddings.
